# README

This is a tutorial on deploying to both Commonjs and ECMAScript modules from typescript without shims or wrappers. Even
though TypeScript fully supported node.js extensions by version 4.9 (problems prior to that), it is not always clear on
how to achieve interoperability.

This tutorial presents one way to achieve the objective of deploying to both.  There are other methods and 
variations, some of which involving wrappers, and no method is necessarily the best one.

The tutorial includes some statements of fact about node.js, JavaScript and TypeScript to support those who may not 
be aware.  It also provides some code proofs or at least examples when encountering key concepts.  Finally, there 
are a few opinionated statements, which will be explicitly called out.
